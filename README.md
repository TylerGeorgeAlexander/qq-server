# Quick Question Server

## Node-Based Application with ChatGPT API and Spaced Interval Repetition

Quick Question Server is a Node.js application that combines the power of the ChatGPT API with Spaced Interval Repetition, inspired by [Dr. Barbara Oakley's Learning How to Learn](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/learning-how-to-learn/) and [CzechUniversities](https://www.czechuniversities.com/article/study-skills-7-spaced-repetition#:~:text=Ideal%20intervals%20are%20as%20follows,into%20your%20long%2Dterm%20memory). You can also enhance your learning experience with [Coursera's Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository using the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

### Usage

1. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the application.
3. Enter your input text into the console and press Enter.
4. Wait for the application to generate output using the ChatGPT API.
5. The output will be displayed in the console.

### Configuration

To use this application, you will need to obtain an API key for the ChatGPT API. You can sign up for an API key at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/).

Once you have obtained an API key, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the cloned repository and add the following line:

```
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

Additional configuration may include setting up:

- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection URI for data storage.
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

### Spaced Interval Repetition

The Spaced Interval Repetition technique used in this application is inspired by Dr. Barbara Oakley and CzechUniversities. It involves repeated revisions at increasing intervals to optimize learning and retention.

Ideal intervals are as follows:

- Day 0 (Cramming)
- Day 1 (First repetition within 24 hours)
- Day 3 (Second repetition)
- 7 days
- 21 days
- 30 days
- 45 days
- 60 days

After several such repetitions, your brain should evaluate that the information is worth remembering and put it into your long-term memory.

### Features

- **Deck Creation:** Save flashcards into different categories or decks for organized learning.

### Notes

- This application is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for production use.
- The ChatGPT API is a paid service. Be sure to check the pricing and billing information on the OpenAI website before using this application.
- This application does not store or transmit any user data outside of the input text and output generated by the ChatGPT API.
